Each thread in the warp steps through the function instructions **together**. If two threads in the same warp encounter **different** instructions, the warp can no longer execute in parallel and the performance benefit of using the GPU can disappear. This is called **warp divergence** (very *Star Trek*). In general, one warp out of 10,000 experiencing divergence will not hurt things too badly -- but a large fraction of warps experiencing it will.\n",

Any of these numbers can be 1 -- but you can also create 3D grids if it's more natural for your problem. In general, it's **not** the case that `n_blocks_x * n_blocks_y * n_blocks_z * n_threads_x * n_threads_y * n_threads_z` threads execute in parallel (though this can happen if the sizes are small).

So, `n_threads_x = 64` would be a good choice, or `n_threads_y = 512`. **In general**, larger thread counts are better (512 threads-per-block is usually more performant than 64) but of course there are some edge cases.\n",

In general, accessing adjacent memory locations in GPU memory is **much** faster than accessing locations that are widely separated. This is because to read a single location, the thread(s) have to load a whole \"word\" of memory at a time, so two memory locations that are part of the same word can be read cheaply once the word is loaded. This is also sometimes called \"coalesced\" memory access. It's most efficient to align warp-reads with 32-byte boundary memory regions -- something that using *strides* can often help with! How much of an impact can this have? For a matrix-matrix multiplication, NVIDIA ran tests on a V100 GPU. The observed memory bandwith was:\n",

It includes a deep dive into **multiple** steps of optimization, which we can quickly summarize here:\n",

        "- Use special warpgroups to work with the output tile (prevents register spilling)\n",
        "- Hide *store* latency by overlapping write operations for one thread block with load operations for another\n",
        "- Force nearby tiles to be scheduled at the same time to use the L2 cache\n",
        "- Use a device assembly instruction to implement a slightly faster barrier\n",
        "- Group multiple thread blocks together into clusters to allow the kernel to load the same tile to multiple SMs\n",

        "- Implement careful scheduling to improve L2 cache hit rate\n",

        "Even with all this work, the optimized kernel is only **7%** faster than `CUBLAS` in the best case, while `CUBLAS` is **generally** quite performant.

Happily, Julia has a high level framework for targeting any of these backends, allowing you to write portable code that can run on various GPUs. This is particularly helpful if you have allocations at a variety of supercomputing centers, which tend to buy large sets of GPUs from either NVIDIA or AMD, and at which AMD is quite common.\n",

So, many features and libraries (like sparse support) you may expect from `CUDA.jl` or `AMDGPU.jl` may not be supported yet (PRs welcome!).

The tuning process can take many days or even weeks, and the results can be very large -- this is why some library shared object files are humongous (100s of MB). To perform tuning you will probably need a large amount of compute, so it is hard to do if you yourself aren't a GPU vendor or a supercomputing center.\n",
